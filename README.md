Vanilla JavaScript
localStorage (to save tasks between sessions)


🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
Open index.html in your browser to start using the app.

💡 How It Works
Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage.

All interactions (add/edit/complete/delete) happen dynamically on the same page.

Each task contains a unique ID, title, optional description, due date, and status.

📌 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
Task filtering (e.g., show only completed/incomplete)

Due date sorting

Search functionality

Dark/Light mode toggle

Category or tag support
